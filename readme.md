Installation
------------

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then just run `npm install roots -g` and you'll be all set.

Usage
-----

Once you have roots installed, you can use the command line to wrangle your project. You must be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to be able to use roots. All the possible command and options are explained clearly on the man page below:

- [See the man page for command line options](http://roots.cx/docs/man.html)

The Future
----------

See the [issues](https://github.com/jenius/roots/issues) for discussion of upcoming features and additions. Roots is very actively developed and is moving forward at a rapid pace. Our goal is to push static sites and "single page apps" as far as they can possibly go, and we're well on the way.

Coding Style

To keep a consistant coding style in the project, we're going with [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html) for JS and [Polar Mobile's guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide) for CoffeeScript. Both of these are pretty standard guides.
