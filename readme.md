# Roots CLI

This is the beginnings of a really fantastic command line build tool. Super super alpha, don't even think about attempting to install this.

The assets and views folders are temporary, just used for example files and convenience during development.

### to do

- layout files
- partials (with locals)
- more efficient file watching
- logic that can happen within the app.js file
- live reloading
